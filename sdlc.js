// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Decide what will be needed to implement the plan made in step one."
const design = "Plan out structure of project including things such as pseudo code, design asthetics, etc."
const implementation = "The actual writing of the code."
const testingAndIntegration = "Checking for bugs. Seeing how it works with the system already put into place and actually including in that system."
const maintain = "Routinely checking on the program to see if it is still working properly, especially as other changes come about in the future."
